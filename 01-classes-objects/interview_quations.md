1. What is a Class?
Answer: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. It is a logical entity.

2. What is an Object?
Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It is a physical entity that occupies memory and is created at runtime. Each object has its own state (values for its attributes) and behavior (methods).

3. What is the relationship between a Class and an Object?
Answer: A class is a blueprint, and an object is a concrete instance built from that blueprint. You can create multiple objects from a single class, just like you can build multiple houses from a single architectural plan.

4. What is the 'new' keyword used for?
Answer: The new keyword is used to dynamically allocate memory for a new object at runtime and to call the class's constructor to initialize that object.
Example (Java): MyClass obj = new MyClass();
